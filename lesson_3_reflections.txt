When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Remote repository is useful for sharing the work with others. But even if you are working alone remote repository is useful as a backup of your work. It also allows you access to your work from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	When repository is shared with other people, you may end up pulling partial changes.
