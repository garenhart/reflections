What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A hidden .git directory is added to the current directory to store
	repository meta-data.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area allows adding files individually until they are ready for a commit, which helps keeping commits smaller.
